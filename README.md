## Technical Details

### Authentication System
- **Storage**: Uses localStorage for user data persistence
- **Security**: Client-side validation and session management
- **Validation**: Email format, password strength, form completeness
- **Session**: Automatic redirect based on authentication status

### Password Requirements
- Minimum 8 characters
- At least one uppercase letter
- At least one lowercase letter
- At least one number
- At least one special character

### Browser Compatibility
- Chrome (recommended)
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge

## Security Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: This is a frontend-only implementation for demonstration purposes. In a production environment, you would need:

- Backend server with proper authentication
- HTTPS encryption
- Password hashing (bcrypt, Argon2)
- JWT or session-based authentication
- CSRF protection
- Rate limiting
- Input sanitization
- Database storage instead of localStorage

## Customization

### Adding More Songs
1. Place MP3 files in the `songs/` directory
2. The system will automatically detect and organize them into playlists

### Styling Changes
- Modify `auth-style.css` for authentication pages
- Modify `style.css` for the main music player
- Colors and themes can be easily customized

### Authentication Features
- Edit `auth.js` to modify validation rules
- Add additional social login providers
- Implement password reset functionality
- Add email verification

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Songs not loading**: Make sure you're running the site through a web server (not just opening HTML files)
2. **Authentication not working**: Clear browser localStorage and try again
3. **Styling issues**: Check that all CSS files are properly linked

### Running Locally
For the best experience, run the site using a local web server:

```bash
# Using Python 3
python -m http.server 8000

# Using Node.js (if you have http-server installed)
npx http-server

# Using PHP
php -S localhost:8000
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.
